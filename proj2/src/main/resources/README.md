# About The Program

## Language Choice

Java was chosen because of my familiarity with it. I've been writing Java professionally for work for about 5 years now, 
and along with what I picked up from school it is by far the language that I am most comfortable working with. This 
allowed me to focus on the concepts being taught with this lesson than having to brush off my rather rusty Python skills. 

## Observations On Different Input

At first, I found it rather difficult to get many deaths of hawks with the default parameters. It seemed that if there
were going to be a death, it was going to be sporadic, and early on in the simulation. Otherwise, it was unlikely to happen. 

What was interesting to see was if I increased the number of hawks, the amount of resources that the hawks possessed began
to decrease. But if I raised the cost of the hawk-hawk interaction, the average resource possessed by the hawks did not change, 
rather the chances that a hawk would die.
